=org-enhanced-priorities= enhances Org-mode's default priority-based
ranking with impact and difficulty. This extra information introduces
more nuanced and fine-level control over agenda sorting, allowing you
to confidently take the next task from the top of the agenda without
wasting time thinking about it.

* Installation

=org-enhanced-priorities= is not yet available via ELPA or other
archives, so you must point use-package at this repo:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org-enhanced-priorities
  :straight (org-enhanced-priorities
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "Robert-Forrest/org-enhanced-priorities")
  :init
  (require 'org-enhanced-priorities))
#+END_SRC
or manually install and add to your load path:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-enhanced-priorities")
(require 'org-enhanced-priorities)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

=org-enhanced-priorities= calculates the overall priority of an item using the
built-in priority property, and the additional properties of impact and
difficulty.

Impact is thought of as "how much positive change will this task create?",
difficulty as "how hard is this task?", and priority takes its usual meaning of
"how urgent is this task?". These properties are assumed to be on a scale of 1-3
(low-high).

The overall priority is the sum of these values after they have been multiplied
by their respective weighting coefficients. The default values are currently:

| Property   | Weighting |
|------------+-----------|
| Priority   |       7.5 |
| Impact     |         2 |
| Difficulty |        -1 |
| Deadline   |         4 |
| Scheduled  |         4 |

Difficulty is negatively weighted such that harder tasks are ranked below easier
ones. =DEADLINE= and =SCHEDULED= properties are taken into account such that
priority increases as deadline dates approach, while priority is decreased until
the scheduled date arrives.

These values can be customised to create whatever ranking system works best for
you, via the variable =org-enhanced-priorities-property-weights=, an association
list of property names and their respective weights. Simply add new key-value
pairs to =org-enhanced-priorities-property-weights= to include other properties
into the overall priority calculation:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-enhanced-priorities-property-weights '("fun" . 10))
#+END_SRC

The contribution made by the vanilla org-mode priority labels (e.g. [#A]) to the
overall priority calculated by this package is determined by normalising the
char value between =org-lowest-priority= and =org-highest-priority=, such that
it is agnostic to the labelling you have configured as long as it is in
accordance with org-mode's expectations of numerical ordering.

*** Example Org entry

The properties :impact: and :difficulty: have been added to this Org
item.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
,* TODO [#A] High-priority Low-impact Medium-difficulty
:PROPERTIES:
:impact: 1
:difficulty: 2
:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Evaluating the following function while the cursor is over the above
item would return 7.5 (assuming the default weights):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-enhanced-priorities--calculate-overall-priority)
#+END_SRC

See the =examples= directory for further exemplary org entries. When the
agenda for the =examples= tasks is sorted using =org-enhanced-priorities=,
the result is the following:

[[./examples/example-agenda.png]]

*** Open highest-priority task

Use =M-x org-enhanced-priorities--highest-priority= to open the org entry which
currently has the highest priority among all entries in your agenda files. You
may optionally set a match expression, this defaults to =/TODO= to only consider
pending tasks, but you could enter =/HOLD= or any other valid match expression
consumable by
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Using-the-Mapping-API.html][org-map-entries]].

*** View all tasks, sorted by priority

Use =M-x org-enhanced-priorities--sorted-entries= to open a temporary buffer
listing all org entries in order of the enhanced priority value. Similar to the
agenda view, pressing =RET= on any entry headline will take you to the entry
itself, while =q= will quit the buffer.

** Agenda

Add the sorting function provided by =org-enhanced-priorities= to your
agenda configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-agenda-cmp-user-defined 'org-enhanced-priorities--agenda-sort-overall-priority)
  (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(user-defined-down))
#+END_SRC

I would highly recommend checking out the [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]] package for
further control over the appearance of the agenda.

** Capture templates

You may find it useful to add the =:impact:= and =:difficulty:= properties
to your task capture templates, so you can easily fill in the values:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-capture-templates `(("t"
                               "Task"
                               entry (file+headline "/path/to/tasks.org" "Tasks"),
                               "* TODO [#B] %? %^G 
:PROPERTIES:
:impact: 2 
:difficulty: 2
:END:"       
             :empty-lines 1)))
#+END_SRC


* Future features

- [X] Arbitrary properties to be included in the ranking process,
  users should be able to define their own properties.
- [X] Better handling of currently hard-coded =PRIORITY= property
  translation from A, B, or C to a number, allow for other letters and
  numerical values.
- [X] Deadlines and scheduling should have an effect on the
  rankings. Priority should increase as deadlines approach, and should
  be zero before the scheduled start-date of a task.
- [X] A command which returns the highest priority task, to be done
  next.
- [ ] Availability of this package via an archive such as ELPA or
  MELPA.
